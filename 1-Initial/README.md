Sure, here is a list of 20 JavaScript exercises that meet the criteria you specified:

## Arrays

1. Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of all the numbers.

Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

Expected output: `15`

2. Write a function that takes an array of strings and returns a new array with only the strings that have a length greater than or equal to 5.

Input: `['apple', 'banana', 'pear', 'kiwi', 'orange']`

Expected output: `['apple', 'banana', 'orange']`

3. Write a function that takes two arrays of numbers and returns a new array containing the unique elements from both arrays.

Input: `([1, 2, 3], [3, 4, 5])`

Expected output: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

4. Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array where each element is multiplied by 10.

Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

Expected output: `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`

5. Write a function that takes an array of objects and returns the object with the highest value for a given property.

Input: `[{name: 'Alice', age: 25}, {name: 'Bob', age: 30}, {name: 'Charlie', age: 20}]`

Expected output: `{name: 'Bob', age: 30}`

## Objects

6. Write a function that takes an object and r
   eturns an array of its keys.

Input: `{a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}`

Expected output: `['a', 'b', 'c']`

7. Write a function that takes an object and returns an array of its values.

Input: `{a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}`

Expected output: `[1, 2, 3]`

8. Write a function that takes two objects and returns a new object with their properties merged.

Input: `({a: 1, b: 2}, {c: 3, d: 4})`

Expected output: `{a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4}`

9. Write a function that takes an object and a key, and returns true if the object contains the given key.

Input: `({a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}, 'b')`

Expected output: `true`

10. Write a function that takes an object and a value, and returns true if the object contains the given value.

Input: `({a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}, 2)`

Expected output: `true`

## Functions

11. Write a function that takes two numbers and returns their sum.

Input: `(2, 3)`

Expected output: `5`

12. Write a function that takes a string and returns the length of the string.

Input: `'hello world'`

Expected output: `11`

13. Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the average of all the numbers.

Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

Expected output: `3`

14. Write a function that takes a callback function and calls it with a message.

Input: `(message => console.log(message), 'Hello, world!')`

Expected output: `Hello, world!`

15. Write a function that takes an object and returns the number of properties it contains.

Input: `{a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}`

Expected output: `3`

## Iterators

16. Write a function that takes an array of numbers and uses the `filter` method to return only even numbers.

Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

Expected output: `[2, 4]`

17. Write a function that takes an array of strings and uses the `map` method to convert each string to uppercase.

Input: `['apple', 'banana', 'pear']`

Expected output: `['APPLE', 'BANANA', 'PEAR']`

18. Write a function that takes an array of numbers and uses the `reduce` method to return the product of all the numbers.

Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

Expected output: `120`

19. Write a generator function that generates the first `n` Fibonacci numbers.

Input: `(5)`

Expected output: `[0, 1, 1, 2, 3]`

20. Write a function that takes an array of numbers and uses the `sort` method to sort the numbers in descending order.

Input: `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5]`

Expected output: `[9, 6, 5, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1]`
